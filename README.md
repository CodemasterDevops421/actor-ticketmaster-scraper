## Overview

Struggling to navigate through Ticketmaster's extensive event listings? Our Ticketmaster Event Finder simplifies your search, pulling data across multiple categories and allowing for intricate filtering not available on Ticketmaster's standard interface. This includes multi-category searches and advanced geographical targeting, perfect for those near borders or looking for events in specific locations.

## Cost Details

This scraper uses [Apify Proxy](https://apify.com/proxy) with a necessity for residential IPs, as Ticketmaster frequently blocks simpler datacenter IPs. The scraper is optimized to reduce the use of compute units and proxy usage, maintaining affordability on the [Apify platform](https://apify.com).

## Result Limits

Configure the `maxItems` setting to control the volume of events retrieved. Ticketmaster's API limitation caps retrievals at 5100 results per run (200 per page over 26 pages).

## Applications

- **Event Tracking**: Automate monitoring for desired events, categories, and locations.
- **Price Monitoring**: Compare and analyze ticket prices across different vendors.
- **Availability Alerts**: Set up alerts to know when tickets go on sale for your favorite events.
- **Market Analysis**: Assess event distributions by type and geography to identify underserved markets.

## Configuring Inputs

You can tailor the scraper to specific needs with several input parameters:
- **Start URLs**: Initiate scraping from specific Ticketmaster pages.
- **Link Depth**: Define how deep the scraper should navigate from the initial pages.
- **Domain Restriction**: Ensure scraping stays within the specified domain to maintain focus and relevancy.

## Data Output

All scraped event data is stored in a structured format in the dataset associated with the scraper run. You can download this data in various formats like JSON, CSV, or Excel. Each record provides detailed information about the event, including:

- **Event ID and URL**
- **Name and Description**
- **Category and Subcategory**
- **Date and Location**
- **Ticketing options and Pricing**
